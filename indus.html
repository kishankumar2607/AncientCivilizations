            The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan
            Civilization, was one of the world's earliest urban societies. It
            flourished in the Indus River basin, covering parts of modern-day
            Pakistan and northwest India. The civilization is renowned for its
            advanced city planning, including the use of standardized bricks and
            a sophisticated drainage system.

            The Indus Valley Civilization began around 3300 BCE with the Early
            Harappan Phase, characterized by the development of agricultural
            villages. The Mature Harappan Phase, starting around 2600 BCE, saw
            the rise of major urban centers like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, which
            were known for their well-planned streets, advanced drainage
            systems, and large public buildings. The Late Harappan Phase, around
            1900 BCE, marked the decline of the civilization, possibly due to
            climatic changes, dwindling resources, or invasions.
